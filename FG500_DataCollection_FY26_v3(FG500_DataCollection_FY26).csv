Goal: ‚ÄúAs described in the Decarbonization section, we have a goal of reducing Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensity by 10% from a 2016 baseline, and we achieved a reduction of approximately 23.4% in 2024, far surpassing our target. In 2021, Bunge announced near-term science-based targets (SBTs). Validated by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi), these targets aim for a 25% reduction in GHG emissions from our operations (Scope 1 and 2) and a 12.3% reduction in our supply chains (Scope 3) by 2030, based on a 2020 baseline. To help achieve these SBTs, we developed and adopted a CTP, aligned with a well-below 2¬∞C pathway‚Äù.

[From https://newclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CorporateClimateResponsibilityMonitor2022.pdf] : 'Carrefour‚Äôs carbon neutral by 2040 target appears to cover far less than 2% of the company‚Äôs emissions. Carrefour announced a new carbon neutrality target for 2040 on the eve of COP26 in October 2021, accompanied by the more specific target to reduce its scope 1 and 2 emissions by 70% by 2040, compared to 2019. This is a direct update of its existing SBTi approved 55% reduction by 2040 target. The significance of these targets is highly limited, since scope 1 and 2 emissions account for just 2% of Carrefour‚Äôs emissions. Carrefour‚Äôs separate interim target of 29% emission reductions from scope 3 emissions by 2030 is a far more significant target, given that scope 3 emissions account for 98% of the company‚Äôs footprint, but these emissions do not appear to be covered by the headline carbon neutrality target.'

CBRE Group, Inc. (NYSE: CBRE) today announced its commitment to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2040. This commitment encompasses carbon emissions from CBRE‚Äôs own operations and the properties it manages for investors and occupiers, as well as indirect supply chain emissions.

‚ÄúAs the world‚Äôs largest manager of commercial real estate, we have a special obligation to help the world address the many challenges posed by the warming planet,‚Äù said Bob Sulentic, CBRE‚Äôs president and chief executive officer. ‚ÄúCBRE is deeply committed to doing our part and to working with our clients and across our vast global supply chain to help achieve net zero emissions as quickly as possible. This is an essential element of our commitment to the communities in which we operate.‚Äù

As a part of its 2040 net-zero emissions strategy, CBRE today signed The Climate Pledge, a commitment to achieving net-zero carbon 10 years ahead of the goal stated in the Paris Agreement. The Climate Pledge, co-founded by Amazon and Global Optimism, forms a cross-sector community of companies and organizations committed to net zero carbon by 2040, working together to take action to address the climate crisis and solve the challenges of decarbonizing our economy.
The net zero commitment builds on the company‚Äôs science-based emissions reduction target announced last year.

To this end, the DZ BANK banking group undertakes to align its portfolios in particularly carbon-intensive sectors with the 1.5¬∞C target. The sector-specific decarbonization pathways are running on a medium to long-term convergence with the 1.5¬∞C reference pathway. Conformity with the 1.5¬∞C target pathway should be achieved in 2050 for selected sectors. The entities in the DZ BANK banking group formally declared this ambition as part of voluntary commitments such as the Net Zero Banking Alliance Germany and the collective commitment to climate action of the German financial sector.

The targets were set on the basis of these scenarios and assumptions. The sector targets for the DZ BANK banking group are aimed at aligning the lending and investment portfolios with the Net Zero Emissions 2050 scenario (NZE) of the International Energy Agency in the long term.

The DZ BANK banking group‚Äôs decarbonization target pathway is broadly aligned with the International Energy Agency‚Äôs Net Zero Emissions (IEA NZE) reference pathway, which is recognized internationally and by the science community and is based on an absolute metric (financed emissions ‚Äì megatonnes CO2eq). The target is limited to upstream oil and gas activities 9 (extraction and production; Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions), not to geographical boundaries.

In-depth breakdown:
""IAG has a 20% reduction target for its net Scope 1 emissions by
2030 compared to 2019 levels and is working towards to net
zero emissions by 2050. Direct emissions associated with IAG‚Äôs
direct operations include emissions from jet fuel, diesel, petrol,
natural gas and halons. Sources of these emissions include
aircraft engines, boilers, auxiliary power units (APUs) and
ground vehicle engines. IAG‚Äôs target to reduce Scope 1
emissions includes reductions from the use of SAF in its gross
emissions calculation. The IAG Scope 1 net emission reduction
target equates to 21.6 million tCO2e by 2030, or 24.8 million
tCO2e in equivalent Scope 1 gross emissions.
Indirect emissions associated with electricity use in ground
facilities like offices, lounges, data centres and hangars
represent less than 1% of total IAG emissions, and, therefore,
IAG does not set a near-term target for the reduction of these
emissions. IAG monitors the use of renewable electricity across
its operations, and we are committed to net zero Scope 2
emissions by 2050.
In 2021 IAG was the first airline group worldwide to set a target
of net zero Scope 3 emissions by 2050. This was
complemented by a target of a 20% reduction in net Scope 3
emissions by 2030, compared to a 2019 baseline. These targets
will be delivered in collaboration with suppliers and other
stakeholders, by monitoring supplier sustainability performance,
engaging with suppliers on their sustainability plans,
embedding climate requirements into supplier contract clauses
and product specifications, and accounting for delivery of
existing supplier targets.""

Today, we are proceeding with plans to demonstrate our Carbon Neutral Factory concept at Mihara Machinery Works in western Japan. We aim to achieve Carbon Neutrality at this manufacturing facility mainly by replacing conventional power sources with green energy derived from renewables, electrifying heat sources, and installing energy management systems. By applying the eÙè∞®perience gained through these eÙè∞äorts and working closely with our peers in industry, we will develop innovative, carbon neutral solutions and propose them to our customers.
