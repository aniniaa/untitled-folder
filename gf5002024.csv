complemented by our $1.5 trillion sustainable finance goal

undertook in 2021 to become Net Zero Carbon

so, the Group set an ambitious trajectory certifi ed
“well below 2°C” by 2030 by the SBTi and given a
score of NZ-2 by Moody’s with its trajectory rated
as 1.5°C and its target implementation as “solid”.

NZ-2 by Moody’s with an ambition aligned
with a 1.5°C trajectory and a solid level on

2045, and offsetting residual emissions

from renewable sources by 2030 (level already achieved in branches and
